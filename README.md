## Heart Attack Analysis
1.	Introduction
 A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying your heart with blood and oxygen becomes blocked. A blood clot can form and block your arteries, causing a heart attack. This Heart Attack Analysis helps to understand the chance of attack occurrence in persons based on varied health conditions.
2.	Dataset
The dataset is Heart_Attack_Analysis_Data.csv. It has been added to this. 
This dataset contains data about some hundreds of patients mentioning Age, Sex, Exercise Include Angia(1=YES, 0=NO), Chest Pain Type(Value 1: typical angina, Value2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic), ECG Results, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Blood Sugar, Family History (Number of persons affected in the family), Maximum Heart Rate, Target -0=LESS CHANCE , 1= MORE CHANCE

## Aim of the assignment is to 

•	Building a Predictive Model    (Which features decide heart attack?)
•	Evaluate the model.
•	Refine the model, as appropriate

## What I need to do?

a)	Select a method for performing the analytic task
b)	Preprocess the data to enhance quality
c)	Carry out descriptive summarization of data and make observations
d)	Identify relevant, irrelevant attributes for building model. 
e)	Perform appropriate data transformations with justifications
f)	Generate new features if needed
g)	Carry out the chosen analytic task. Show results including intermediate results, as needed
h)	Evaluate the solutions
i)	Look for refinement opportunities
