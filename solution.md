# Heart Attack Analysis: Solution Decision Points

## 1. Analytic Method Selection
- Options:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
- Initial choice: Start with Logistic Regression for interpretability, then compare with tree-based models.

## 2. Data Preprocessing
- Options:
  - Handle missing values (drop, impute)
  - Encode categorical variables (one-hot, label encoding)
  - Scale/normalize features (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Initial choice: Check for missing values, use label encoding for categorical features, standard scaling for numeric features.

## 3. Descriptive Summarization
- Options:
  - Summary statistics (mean, std, min, max)
  - Value counts for categorical features
  - Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap)
- Initial choice: Print summary statistics and value counts, plot histograms and correlation heatmap.

## 4. Feature Selection
- Options:
  - Correlation analysis
  - Feature importance from models
  - Recursive feature elimination
- Initial choice: Use correlation and model-based feature importance.

## 5. Data Transformation
- Options:
  - Binning continuous variables
  - Log transformation for skewed features
  - Polynomial features
- Initial choice: Apply transformations if EDA suggests skewness or non-linearity.

## 6. Feature Engineering
- Options:
  - Combine features (e.g., ratios)
  - Create interaction terms
  - Domain-specific features
- Initial choice: Explore after initial model evaluation.

## 7. Model Evaluation
- Options:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC
  - Confusion Matrix
- Initial choice: Use accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## 8. Model Refinement
- Options:
  - Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
  - Try different algorithms
  - Feature engineering
- Initial choice: Tune hyperparameters and try top 2-3 models.
